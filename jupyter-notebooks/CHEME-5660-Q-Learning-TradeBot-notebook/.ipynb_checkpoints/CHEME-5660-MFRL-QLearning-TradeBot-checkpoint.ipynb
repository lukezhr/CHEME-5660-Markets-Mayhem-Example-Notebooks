In particular, we've downloaded `5 min` Open High Low Close (OHLC) data for the 150 tickers in the `CHEME 5660 portfolio` from [Polygon.io](https://polygon.io). From this data, we'll use the Q-learning approach from [Chapter 17 of Kochenderfer et al.

    "Now that we have our state classes (and our state classifier) let's turn our attention to the online estimation of the state-action-value matrix, otherwise known as the $ Q$ function. Imagine a scenario in which we don't know the transition matrix $T_{a}(s,s^{\\prime})$ or the rewards array $R(s, a)$. Instead, we let our system learn by trying different actions in different states and seeing what reward we get. Thus, we allow our agent to learn by example. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we allow the agent to execute random actions (exploration) or execute its best guess of the optimal move, and then we observe the reward received. \n",
    "* The action space in this example is $\\mathcal{A}=\\left\\{\\mathtt{buy}, \\mathtt{sell}, \\mathtt{hold}\\right\\}$; thus, we either buy $n_{a}$ shares of `XYZ`, sell $n_{a}$ shares of `XYZ` or do nothing. \n",
    "* The state space $\\mathcal{S}$ is described above: $s_{1}$: current share close to but above some long-term expected price, $s_{2}$: current share price well above some long-term expected price, $s_{3}$: current share close to but below some long-term expected price and $s_{4}$: current share price well below some long-term expected price.\n",
    "* The reward we have chosen is the liquidation value on a per share basis of our position, i.e., what value could we get if we sold everything at the _next available market price_. In our case, we are using `5 min` data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Computational details\n",
    "* We do a random action $\\epsilon$ of the time; otherwise, we let the agent execute its best estimate of the optimal action.\n",
    "* We run `number_of_trials`, collect the $Q$-function for each trial and estimate a policy $\\pi(s)$ from the $Q(s, a)$ table for each trial. \n",
    "* After finishing `number_of_trials` and analyzing the data, we build a table with the recommended action for each state.\n",
    "* The update function was taken from `Algorithm 17.2` from [Kochenderfer et al. (2022)](https://algorithmsbook.com)\n",
    "* The current implementation of the code is slow. You've been warned. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interesting question:\n",
    "* I can imagine several `expert` policies, e.g., `buy the dip, sell the bounce`, a policy of 2,2,1,1. Alternatively, you could get `don't play small ball`, meaning wait for large swings to do anything (this has a policy of 3,2,3,1). Do we recover either of these policies? "
