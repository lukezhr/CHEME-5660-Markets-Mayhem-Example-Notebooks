    "#### Treasury Bills\n",
    "Treasury bills (called T-bills) are short-term debt instruments ranging from a few days to 52 weeks. When a T-bill matures, the bill holder is paid the par amount. The U.S. Treasury sells T-bills at a discount from the par amount; rarely are they sold at a price equal to the par amount. The U.S. Treasury auctions T-bills with terms of 4, 8, 13, 26, and 52 weeks on a regular schedule. \n",
    "\n",
    "T-bills are an example of a zero-coupon fixed-income instrument; thus, T-bills do not make coupon payments during the bond term. Instead, the bondholder receives the par value at the bill's period. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let a zero-coupon T-bill have a term of $T$-years with an annual market interest rate of $\\bar{r}$. Then, the _fair price_ for a zero-coupon T-bill, denoted by $V_{B}$, is the future par value $V_{P}$ of the bill discounted to the time of the purchase:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V_{B} = \\frac{V_{P}}{\\left(1+\\bar{r}\\right)^{T}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Treasury Bonds\n",
    "Treasury Bonds are long-term U.S Treasury debt instruments. Treasury bonds pay a fixed rate of interest (the coupon rate) every six months until the bond's maturity. The U.S. Treasury issues bonds with terms of 20 or 30 years. When a bond matures, the bondholder receives the face value of the bond. Bonds can be held until maturity or sold before maturity. \n",
    "\n",
    "When a U.S. Treasury bond matures, the U.S government repays the debt by paying the bond's par value. The bond's coupon rate determines the interest payment: the annual payment is the coupon rate times the bond's par value. The coupon rate, maturity date, and par value of the bond are part of the contract between the issuer, the U.S. government, and the bondholder (you).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let the term of a bond be $T$-years, with an annual coupon rate of $\\bar{c}$. Then, a _fair price_ for the bond, denoted by $V_{B}$, is the present value of coupon payments $C$ plus the discounted par value $V_{P}$ of the bond:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V_{B} = \\frac{V_{P}}{\\left(1+i\\right)^{N}}+\\sum_{j=1}^{N}\\frac{C}{\\left(1+i\\right)^{j}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $N$ denotes the number of coupon payments, $i = \\bar{r}/2$ denotes the market interest rate, and $C=(\\bar{c}/2)\\cdot{V_{P}}$ is the value of the coupon payment."
