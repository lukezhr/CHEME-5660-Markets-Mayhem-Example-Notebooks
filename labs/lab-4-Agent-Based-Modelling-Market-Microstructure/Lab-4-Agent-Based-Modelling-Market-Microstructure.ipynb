    "### Motivation\n",
    "In previous weeks, we have treated financial markets as a *macroscopic* system, where the overall market behavior can be simulated using various equation-based methods. These models provide us with a way to relate features, such as implied volatility and the risk-free rate of return, to a distribution of price over time. These methods are well-established for supporting financial decision-making—but, as with all models, they come with limitations. Among them, is the difficulty extending their use to beyond the view of a single asset and modeling extreme events.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Financial markets are not governed by a central mathematical process. Instead, they are composed of complex and evolving interactions that are difficult to define. Systems that exhibit these kinds of dynamics are known as *Complex adaptive systems* (CAS), in which the micro-scale behaviors of individual actors or agents coalesce to generate *emergent properties* at the macro-scale. In financial systems, emergent properties can manifest unexpectedly and have varying consequences. One example of emergence is the price discovery process, in which the price series of an asset is determined through the individual orders submitted by various buyers and sellers. Other types of emergent phenomena can be irrational and deviate significantly from historical events, such as the *flash crash*. A flash crash is a sudden and extreme drop in asset value that can have lingering and widespread effects on the market.\n",

    "### Market Microstructure\n",
    "Market microstructure examines the explicit trading rules and mechanisms of exchanges and the effects they have on market outcomes and trading behavior. Briefly, let's introduce two key components of market microstructure:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Electronic exchanges (Networks and Order types)**\n",
    "    - Electronic exchanges are virtual platforms that facilitate trades for market participants. There are several venues where trade execution can take place and orders can be submitted over a network from anywhere; therefore, latency plays a role in the outcome of a trade. \n",
    "    - Exchanges offer investors a choice of several order types (e.g., limit orders, market orders, cancel orders, etc.), which allow orders to be submitted passively or aggressively. \n",
    "- **Order Books (Matching Algorithms and Liquidity)**\n",
    "    - Order books represent the queue of pending orders for a particular asset and match orders based on a matching algorithm (typically price-time priority).\n",
    "    - Physical representation of supply and demand: buyers submit *bids* and sellers submit *asks*. The difference between the best bid and best ask is known as the *bid/ask spread*. Order books capture the supply and demand forces that drive price movement and contain information such as the market's sentiment of an asset.\n",
    "    - *Liquidity* is the measure of how easy it is to carry out a transaction at a stable price; illiquid assets have sparse order books with a wide bid-ask spread. Market makers provide liquidity by maintaining concurrent offers to carry out transactions between both buyers and sellers.\n",
    "- For more information, view the online book chapter over [Markets, Exchanges and Investment Instruments](https://varnerlab.github.io/CHEME-5660-Markets-Mayhem-Book/chapter-1-dir/markets.html#markets-exchanges-and-investment-instruments).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why does this matter?**\n",
    "- Market participants have different goals\n",
    "    - Market maker vs. retail investor\n",
    "- Execution workflows\n",
    "    - Market impact\n",
    "    - Market slippage\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Order book demo\n",
    "Let's run through a demo of key microstructural features. \n",
    "1. Limit Order vs. Market Order\n",
    "2. Liquid asset vs. illiquid asset\n",

    "### Agent-Based Modeling\n",
    "Agent-Based Modeling is a simulation paradigm with three design elements:\n",
    "1. **Software agents.** Agents are entities that act autonomously and according to pre-defined rules and objectives. The agents can be heterogenous, i.e., they can be defined with different properties and exhibit fundamentally different behaviors.\n",
    "2. **Interaction mechanism.** Agents interact with one another through both their rules (actions they are allowed to take) and the explicit structure to which they are linked.\n",
    "3. **Environment.** The environment defines the state of the system. This includes the observable variables, external shocks to the system, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "ABMs capture key features of complex systems—in particular, emergent properties, non-linearity, and heterogeneity. These features arise naturally as a result of the micro-scale interactions; that is, macroscopic properties of the system emerge without being explicity constrained, or under any assumption, to do so. To generate realistic behavior, ABMs typically undergo both a calibration and validation procedure. To calibrate the model, model parameters are configured by heuristic methods, initializing the model with empirical microscopic data, etc. To validate the model, statistical test can be run on the outputs and measured against what is known about the system, or the outputs can be measured against empirical macroscopic data. \n",

    "#### SFI Artificial Stock Market (SFI-ASM)  model\n",
    "The SFI-ASM was developed in the 1990's and was one of the first agent-based financial market platforms. The SFI-ASM has the following ABM structure:\n",
    "1. **Software agents.** A collection of `N` agents make trading decisions based on their prediction of the next time period $t$ stock price $p_t$ & dividend $d_t$. Each agent $i$ uses predictions that are given by an evolving set of trading strategies, \"predictors\", which makes the agents heterogenous. The \"predictors\" are activated depending on the market state and are selected based on how well they have performed in the past. \n",
    "2. **Interaction mechanism.** Agents interact with one another by sending their \"demand\" $X_{i,t} (p_t)$ (desired number of share holdings) to the \"Specialist\" who attempts to match buy and sell orders and set a clearing price to close the trading round.\n",
    "3. **Environment.** The simulation runs in discrete time steps $t$ = {0, 1, 2,.., $T$} and provides the agents with two options: place their cash in a risky asset that pays a dividend $d_t$ or a bank account with a constant riskless return `r`. The history of past prices and dividends is observable to the agents, along with the current dividend, which is published at the beginning of each time step. The dividends are generated by a random process unknown to the agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The set of \"predictors\" $J$, unique to each agent, works by forming a linear function of the expected price + dividend:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{E}_t (p_{t+1}+d_{t+1}) = a_{j}(p_t+d_t)+b_{j}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $a$ and $b$ are unique to individual predictor $j$ and are subject to change over time. The accuracy, or prediction variance, of each predictor is updated each time step according to an exponentially weighted average of squared forecast error with horizon length `τ`. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this model, the dividend is determined by an [AR(1) process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_model) and the total amount of shares issued is equal to the number of agents `N`. Thus, for each trading round, the \"Specialist\" must balance the total demand to the fixed supply of shares and converge to a clearing price according to the following expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_{i,t}(p_t) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{a_{i,j}(p_t+d_t)+b_{i,j}-p_t(1+r)}{\\lambda \\hat{\\sigma}_{i,j,t}^2} = N$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where `𝜆` represents an agent's risk aversion and $\\sigma^2$ denotes the variance given by the selected \"predictor\" $j$. The above expression demonstrates how each agent's \"demand\" $X_{i,t} (p_t)$ reflects an objective to maximize their [expected utility of wealth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_utility_hypothesis). \n",
    "\n",
    "At every time step, each agent $i$ with probability $P_k$ will update their set of predictors via a genetic algorithm. For each agent, this learning procedure takes place every `k` steps on average and replaces the $a$ and $b$ parameters of the lowest performing predictors. \n",
    "\n",
    "The learning rate `k` and relevant forecast time horizon `τ` are crucial design parameters. They dictate how often agents adapt and how sharp the adjustments are. "
